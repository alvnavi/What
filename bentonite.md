Looking to ferment clearer meads & wines? Use Bentonite Clay in your next batch! Bentonite is an absorbent clay that is used as a fining agent or clarifier. It helps prevent cloudiness and haze in wines, meads, ciders & juices.

Bentonite Clay bonds to suspended yeast, sediment & other stubborn particles and helps pull them out of suspension. The finished wine will exhibit better clarity and color, as well as reduced off-flavors and reduced oxidation potential.
